##### What did I accomplish yesterday?
- Tracing and comprehending components of iaas-vm-control, taking time to ensure all pieces are found and accommodated for before doing a build
##### What will I do today?

	- state stuff can go
	- bootstrap iaas to see if it is still used
	- Hooks are pre start/post stop scripts
