Triage after incident is raised, then send to correct issue, and follow up, and write  a report afterwards

Ben is going on holiday in a few weeks time, David will investigate d-sds patching issues 

Will be diagnosing VM crash dump, create an issue, if it happens after a few times it needs to be expedited, but full investigation needs to be a full on time sync.

New joiner Ruben will be here on the 12th, induction tasks for the first week. Transitioning from another role, he had done a lot of old Kubernetes stuff at his old company.
