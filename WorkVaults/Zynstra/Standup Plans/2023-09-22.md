##### What did I accomplish yesterday?
- Removing to hook scripts
- Call with Richard
	- Additional payload
##### What will I do today?
- Investigate to see why issuing migrate in the ZCC is immediately successful
	- Additionally starting state is seen after migration 'disappears( is completed)
	- *maybe* extend to have another 'migrate registered' payload 
- Have CO KT demo with Tom 
- Reserve stop for bowling

##### What obstacles are impeding my progress?
