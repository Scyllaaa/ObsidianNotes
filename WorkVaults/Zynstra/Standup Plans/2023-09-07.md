```
- `zmigrate -rba` is returning a false negative.
```Bash
2023-09-07 10:31:36,060 - zmigrate - DEBUG - Successfully ran SSH command. Returncode: 0
2023-09-07 10:31:36,061 - zmigrate - DEBUG - False #  log.debug(bool(non_migratable_vms))
2023-09-07 10:31:36,061 - zmigrate - DEBUG - [] #  log.debug(non_migratable_vms)
2023-09-07 10:31:36,061 - zmigrate - DEBUG - False # log.debug(bool(all(migration_results.values())))
2023-09-07 10:31:36,061 - zmigrate - DEBUG - {'Remote': None} #     log.debug(migration_results)
```

- Issue resolved, it was the function responsible for issuing the SSH command that was returning None, when it should've been a bool. None being a falsy type, it though the remote migration had failed.
- [ ] Test changes that Dave and I did yesterday for the AF issue
- [ ] Go through changes to KT that were made by David yesterday
	- [ ] Have an hour with Shaun to run through the CO KT
	- [ ] Set up environment so it is ready for the demo tomorrow
		- [ ] Redeploy 8a/8b overnight so that it is fresh tomoz
		- [ ] Transfer AdvEng Script to a `zapp` on there. 

- New zmigrate issue when using `recall-all` and `-no-priority` and `quiet`
