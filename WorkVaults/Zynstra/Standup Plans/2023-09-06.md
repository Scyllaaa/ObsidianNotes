Bullets points what, why 
2nd powerpoint then high level of flow, see slack- how
Going into the fragments of zynclone, folloiwng the flow of the overview

most useful thing to tom is about how the client is interacting with it, ie.e powershell scripts and desktop icons, plus screenshots, \

add reference to path to powershell scripts

run start co script, update on original, then run again, does cutover, and done.

Is there an example of a real world - ask shaun in the office tomorrow, at the back near nicks office, short hair quite tall, foam on the coffee machine, ask to check the work, re-phrasing, anything left out ppls should know, diagrams that may help

- Add in CO background form ddavid


- Add in an anecdote e.g. imagine in real world, costs, petrol pumps need updating, Shaun might have the numbers for the loss over a year
Made subcomponents into shells with each location

- Add service diagram that david sent
- also add PowerShell which describes the payload of each customer VM


- unorthodox nature of putting our code on a customer VM, usually do not touch payload, just do infrastructure, but for CO operations we 'must' (why?)
- We provide a framework which they can use their own powershell code - ask shaun, 


- Work on doing the demo
	- System ready with continuois operatuons
