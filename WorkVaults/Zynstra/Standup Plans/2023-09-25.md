##### What did I accomplish yesterday?
- Changed gears after rich brought up some issues
##### What will I do today?
- Review port of vm_state_monitor to python3
- Investigating bugs during ZCC migration, payloads seems to come through okay, one appeared to be sent in twice (?), migration 
- Removal Work
	- `eng_check_target_state` are mostly removes, want to go through the mr changes to ensure this
	- on upgrade, will log files get removed? Need to make a script on upgrade to remove this?
- change monitoring, remove redundant function `get_remote_free_memory`
- Have another attempt at changing the CO hooks to allow for a wait time in order to prepare demo.
