The Xen library, or libxenlight, is a userspace library that allows programs to interact with the Xen hypervisor. It provides a set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that enable developers to control various aspects of VMs and the hypervisor.

**Management and Control** 
With libxenlight, developers can create, start, stop, pause, and manage VMs programmatically. It allows applications to query information about the VMs, such as their status, resource utilization, and network configuration.
