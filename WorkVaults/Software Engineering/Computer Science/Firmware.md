**Firmware** is a specific class of [computer software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_software "Computer software") that provides the [low-level control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-_and_low-level "High- and low-level") for a device's specific [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware"). Firmware, such as the [[BIOS]] of a personal computer, may contain basic functions of a device, and may provide [[hardware abstraction]] services to higher-level software such as [[operating systems]]. For less complex devices, firmware may act as the device's complete operating system, performing all control, monitoring and data manipulation functions. Typical examples of devices containing firmware are [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_systems "Embedded systems") (running [embedded software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_software "Embedded software")), home and personal-use appliances, computers, and [computer peripherals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_peripheral "Computer peripheral").
