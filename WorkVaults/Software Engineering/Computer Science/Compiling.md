Compiling takes computer code and translates it into machine code. Compilation is always targeted toward specific "architectures" usually 32-bit or 64-bit, depending on what machines you intend to use the software on. The compilation process is also performed per OS so you might have a 32 bit windows version, 64 bit windows version, 32 bit [[linux]] ubuntu version, etc.
