### Collection protocols

One can organize the different collections in Python according to which protocols they support: 

| Protocol | Implementing collections | 
| ----------|  -----------------------| 
| [[Container]] | str, list, dict, range tuple, set , bytes|  
| [[Sized]] | str, list, dict, range tuple, set , bytes | 
| [[Iterable]] | str, list, dict, range tuple, set , bytes | 
| [[Sequence]] | str, list, dict, range tuple, set , bytes | 
| [[Mutable Sequence]] | list | 
| [[Mutable Set]] | set | 
| [[Mutable Mapping]] | dict | 

Support for a protocol demands specific behavior from a type.
