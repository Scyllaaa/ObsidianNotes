- Immutable sequences of arbitrary objects
- They are deiminated by parenthesis e.g. h = (193, 391, 2)
- Can access the elements of a tuple by 0-based index using square brackets


-  Cannot create a single element tuple like h = (391) as Python parses that as an integer enclosed in precedence controlling parentheses of a math expression.
- To create a single element tuple we make use of the [[Trailing Comma Separator]], which we are allowed to use when defining literal tuples, lists, and dictionaries. e.g. h = (391, )
