Sequence representing an arithmetic progression of integers.
- Ranges are created by calls to the `range()` constructor and there is no [[literal form]].


## `range()` Signature

range(stop)
range(start, stop)
range(start, stop, step)

- range doesn't support keyword arguments.

If you were to need a counter, you should use the built-in [[Enumerate Function|enumerate function]].
