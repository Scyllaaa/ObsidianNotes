- You can remove an element from a list by index using a keyword with the [[del keyword]].
- It is also possible to remove elements from a list by value rather than by position using the `list.remove()` method. 
	- This is the equivalent to passing the result of the index method to the [[del keyword]]
	- This also raises a value error if a matching element is not present.
