`__init__()`

Instance method for initializing new objects.


`__init__()` in Python is an initializer, not a constructor
`self` is similar to `this` in Java, C# or `C++`.


By convention, implementation details which are not intended for consumption or manipulation by clients of the object start with **underscore**.
