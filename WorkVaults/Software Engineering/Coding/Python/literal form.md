A literal in Python is a syntax that is used to completely express a fixed value of a specific data type. Literals are constants that are self-explanatory and don’t need to be computed or evaluated. They are used to provide variable values or to directly utilize them in expressions. Generally, literals are a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. They can also be defined as raw values or data given in variables or constants.
