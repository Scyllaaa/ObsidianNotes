- **Initialization of objects**: Constructors are used to initialize the objects of a class. They allow you to set default values for attributes or properties, and also allow you to initialize the object with custom data.
- **Easy to implement:** Constructors are easy to implement in Python, and can be defined using the `__init__()` method.
- Better readability: Constructors improve the readability of the code by making it clear what values are being initialized and how they are being initialized.
- **Encapsulation**: Constructors can be used to enforce encapsulation, by ensuring that the objectâ€™s attributes are initialized correctly and in a controlled manner.
