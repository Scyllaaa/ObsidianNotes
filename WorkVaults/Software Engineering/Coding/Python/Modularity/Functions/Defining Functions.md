- In Python a function is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, an argument list in parenthesis, and a colon to start a new block.
- The code inside the function block must be indented
-  We use the return keyword to return a value from the function

- We call functions by providing the actual arguments in parenthesis after the function name

- Function are not required to return a value, they can produce side effects. However it is good practice to create functions that return values rather than cause effects.
