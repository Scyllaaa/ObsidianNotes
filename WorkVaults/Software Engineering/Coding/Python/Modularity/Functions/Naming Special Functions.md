- In Python many language features are implemented using specially named objects and functions
- These special names generally have two leading and two trailing underscores
- This has the benefit of making them visually distinct, easy to remember, and unlikely to collide with other names.
- However this does make them more difficult to pronounce, which can be a problem during collaboration.
- Some developers have opted to use the term "dunder" as a way of pronouncing special names
	- This is a portmanteau of "double underscore"
