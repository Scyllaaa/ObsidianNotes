A virtual environment is a way to have multiple, parallel instances of the Python interpreter, each with different package sets and different configurations. Each virtual environment contains a discrete copy of the Python interpreter, including copies of its support utilities.

The packages installed in each virtual environment are seen only in that virtual environment and no other. Even large, complex packages with platform-dependent binaries can be corralled off from each other in virtual environments.
