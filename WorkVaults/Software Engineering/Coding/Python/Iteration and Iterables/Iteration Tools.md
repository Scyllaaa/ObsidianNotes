### Batteries Included
- Python provides a powerful vocabulary for working with iterators. 
- These include the familiar [[Enumerate Function]] and [[sum()]]
- The [[itertools]] module provides many more

## Boolean Aggregation
- Two other useful built-ins which facilitate elegant programs are:
- [[any()]] - Determines if any elements in a series are true.
- [[all()]] Determines if all elements in a series are true.


- Finally there is [[zip()]] which Synchronizes iteration across two or more iterables.
