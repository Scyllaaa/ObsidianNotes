### Why create Go?

- 3 categories of programming languages
- Efficient compilation, ease of programming, efficient execution(C++). 
- None of the major leagues solve all three of the problems, hence Go was designed 
### Language Characteristics
- Go has  a Strong, [[static type system]]. Well known by,  higher level tooling support (more hep from IDE) and compiler can generate more optimized outputs.
- [[C inspired syntax]], but re-examined so syntax flowed for both a programmer and the optimization process. 
- [[Multi-paradigm]] - adopt a scripting style for each use case.
	- Procedural
	- Object oriented
- [[Garbage collection]]- no need for manual memory management.
- [[Fully Compiled]] - compiled down to executable binary for high level performance
- [[Rapid Compilation]] - important for test-style production
- [[Single binary output]] - simple deployments, single file output
	- this is default, but as Go has evolved, the plugin ecosystem has allowed 
	- shared and dedicated library
- [[Go Cross-platform Nature|cross platform]] - has platform-specific compilers.
### Philosophy and Values 

- [[Simplicity]]
- [[Network aware and Concurrent Apps]]
- [[Out-of-the-box experience]]
- [[Go Cross-platform Nature|cross platform]]
- [[Backward Compatibility]]  

### Primary Use Cases
- Web services - moving data between servers
- Web application -  deliver HTML to end user
- DevOps - [[Docker]], [[Kubernetes]]
- GUI /Thick-client
- Machine learning
- [[Go Packages]]
